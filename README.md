# map-soluna

Hex based map tool for my Dungeons & Dragons campaign setting "Soluna". In the end my players should be able to:

- adding/changing labels itself
- changing terrain (from unknown to whatever the terrain is)
- adding notes (npcs, locations, etc.)

working prototype: https://coffeepyros.github.io/map-soluna/

## todo

- adding columns to the right
- adding row (top and bottom)
- permanently writing new map data to file / cloud (haven't learned this yet)

## working

- rendering js object data as hex map
- reading cells
- adding columns to the left
