# map-soluna

Hex based map tool for my Dungeons & Dragons campaign setting "Soluna". In the end my players should be able to:

- adding/changing labels itself
- changing terrain (from unknown to whatever the terrain is)
- adding notes (npcs, locations, etc.)

working prototype: https://coffeepyros.github.io/map-soluna/

## todo

- if the map gets too big, the interface should still be visible and not being scrolled out
- research zooming part of your website
- permanently writing new map data to file / cloud (haven't learned this yet)

## working

- rendering js object data as hex map
- reading cells
- editing the content of the cells
- adding rows and columns
- exporting/importing as JSON
- overlay for cell notes if present
